# Introduction

OpenSolid is a set of Elm packages for working with 2D and 3D geometry:

  - [opensolid/core](https://github.com/opensolid/core) contains the OpenSolid
    core data types such as points, vectors and coordinate frames
  - [opensolid/geometry](https://github.com/opensolid/geometry) includes
    functionality for dealing with line segments, triangles, polylines and
    polygons
  - [opensolid/svg](https://github.com/opensolid/svg) allows rendering 2D
    OpenSolid types as SVG

These guides expand on the API documentation provided by each package to
describe and explain some of the higher-level concepts used in OpenSolid.
